Big List of things To Do:
1. Dynamically determine missing pieces for added torrents (+--resume option in CLI?)
2. Add download-specific statistics: # of connected peers, % complete (# pieces downloaded/total pieces? or
num pieces * piece size / total size), 2s window connection speed?, # of trackers.
3. Show better progress in the CLI.
4. Refactor piece selection/requesting. Verify this works with multiple peers.
5. More robust file access error handling.
6. Add overall statistics?
7. Test/verify downloading multiple torrents at once.
8. Add uploading/responding to requests from peers.
9. Allow selecting the files to download.
10. Simple TUI
11. Add piece-selecting strategies?
12. Tests.
13. Actually bind to the port we tell the tracker we're listening on? (maybe eventually, but never intended to be a full-on seeding application, for now).
