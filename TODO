Longer term to do/ideas:
1. UDP protocol.
2. GUI
3. Add overall statistics?
4. Allow selecting the files to download.
5. Add piece-selecting strategies?
6. Tests.
7. Add uploading/responding to requests from peers.
8. Actually bind to the port we tell the tracker we're listening on?
   (maybe eventually, but never intended to be a full-on seeding application, for now).
