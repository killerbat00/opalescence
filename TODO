Big List of things To Do:
1. Actually bind to the port we tell the tracker we're listening on.
2. Dynamically determine missing pieces for added torrents (+--resume option in CLI?)
3. Add download-specific statistics: # of connected peers, % complete (# pieces downloaded/total pieces? or
num pieces * piece size / total size), 2s window connection speed?
4. Refactor piece selection/requesting. Verify this works with multiple peers.
