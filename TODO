Big List of things To Do:
1. Dynamically determine missing pieces for added torrents (+--resume option in CLI?)
2. Add download-specific statistics: # of connected peers, % complete (# pieces downloaded/total pieces? or
num pieces * piece size / total size), 2s window connection speed?, # of trackers.
3. Refactor piece selection/requesting. Verify this works with multiple peers.
4. Add overall statistics?
5. Test/verify downloading multiple torrents at once.
6. Actually bind to the port we tell the tracker we're listening on.
