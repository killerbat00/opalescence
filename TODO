Big List of things To Do:
1. Actually bind to the port we tell the tracker we're listening on.
2. Use async_timeout context managers.
3. Best way for callbacks to fire when the loop ends? (cleanup/close *IO classes without needing references to them at
the point we know the loop closes)
4. Convert peer communication to an asyncio.Protocol class.
