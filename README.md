# opalescence

One day this project will grow to be a humble, yet useful torrent client.
A torrent client that strives not to impress, but rather to just...exist.

Currently, it's a glorified bencoder and torrent creation machine. (with tests!)

#TODO
- [ ] get rid of dependency on weird config.py file
- [ ] better tests
- [ ] respect encoding directory


#### far in the future functionality:
- [ ] diffing between Torrents?
- [ ] tracker comm
- [ ] ui?
