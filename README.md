One day this project will grow to be a humble, yet useful torrent client.
A torrent client that strives not to impress, but rather to just...exist.

Currently, it's a glorified torrent creation machine.

#TODO
- [*] refactor torrent creation from path
- [*] simplify torrent translation lifecycle (textfile -> pyobject -> Torrent)
- [ ] more effective torrent dictionary verification after decoding and before encoding
